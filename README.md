# AssessmentManager
 
This is a project in the course Architecture and Software Quality, more specifically Test Driven Development at the ECAM.

The Assessment goes as follows, we worked on a project with atleast 10 classes during a couple of weeks. After that, the projects were redistributed amongst the other groups and we had to implement different test tools using jenkins and maven on the new project.
